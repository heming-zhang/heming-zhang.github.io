### 1.1 Introduction
We show that graph pooling operators can be seen as the combination of three functions: ***selction, reduction, and connection(SRC)***. The selection function groups the nodes of the input graph into subsets called supernodes; then, the reduction function aggregates each supernode to form an output node and its attributes
